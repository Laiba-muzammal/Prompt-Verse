    <h1 class="text-white mb-4">Why We Built This</h1>

    <p class="text-white">
      <strong>PromptVerse</strong> is a smart, minimal web platform designed to help users write, collect, and organize powerful prompts.
      Whether you're crafting prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT, saving creative ideas, or testing how different inputs behave — PromptVerse gives you a clean, distraction-free space to focus on what matters: your words.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
      Users can submit prompts directly through the interface, and in future updates, PromptVerse will generate AI responses based on those prompts — making it a perfect companion for content creators, developers, students, and prompt engineers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
      PromptVerse is lightweight, fast, and mobile-friendly — built using <strong>Flask (Python)</strong> for the backend and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for the frontend. It prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and functionality.
    </p>

    <p class="text-white">
      This is not just a practice project — it's the starting point of a real-world tool that can grow into an AI-backed assistant for prompt testing and learning.
    </p>
