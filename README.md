## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out
This isn’t just a basic chatbot—it’s a structured prompt management platform that combines:

Secure user-based sessions
Database-driven storage and retrieval
AI interactions with real-time feedback
UX polish including error handling and responsiveness
It shows proficiency across backend, frontend, database design, authentication, and API integration—perfectly suited for a resume or portfolio.
